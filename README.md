# Homelessness Data Visualization

This is a data visualization on homelessness in the U.S. using d3.js. This project uses an external csv file for the data, so it is necessary to run it through a server, which can be local.

### Instructions

Use the drop down menu to select a state and add it to the graph. Each state has a random color generated for it, which will become the stroke color for line as well as the state's background color in the legend. Hovering over the circles on the lines will show you the exact percentage for each data point. To clear all data from the graph, click "Reset Graph".
