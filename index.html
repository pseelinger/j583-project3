  <h1>The Unsheltered Homeless</h1>
    <p>A certain subset of homeless people in the United States falls into a category labeled "unsheletered". This refers to those individuals who meet the critria for homelessness, but
    are also unable to regularly find some sort of shelter at night, such as a homeless shelter. In most states, a large percentage of the homeless population falls into that category
    due to the fact that there are just simply not enought shelters to house the nation's large homeless population.</p>
    <p>Below is a graph showing the percentage of each state's homeless population that is unsheltered. Use the drop down menu to compare states, or to compare a state against the national average.
     You can also hover over the points for each year to see the exact percentage. Clicking "Reset Graph" will clear all lines off the graph.</p>
