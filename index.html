<title>Homelessness in the U.S.</title>

  <h1>The Unsheltered Homeless</h1>
    <p>It may seem a bit redunant to call homeless people "unsheltered", but the term refers to a specific set of people. The fact is, there are not enough shelters
    in the U.S. to house its large homeless population, even temporarily. Below is a graph of the percentage of a state's total homeless population that cannot
    find shelter. From 2007 to 2014, we've seen a slight decrease in these percentages overall, but some states have seen a significant increase in their unsheltered homeless
    populations. Select a state from the dropdown menu to see the data, and hover above the line to view info about individual years.</p>
